# Supplementary Material for "Stable Voting and the Splitting of Cycles"

1. 01-counterexamples.ipynb: Notebook containing the code to use the SAT solver to find ordinal margin matrices that have Simple Stable Voting winners that are not Split Cycle winners. 

2. 02-tournament.ipynb: Code used to search for counterexamples on each of the 456 tournament isomorphism classes of size 7.  Counterexamples are added to the directory "witnesses" as they are found.  

3. 03-tied-margins.ipynb: This notebook contains a counterexample to Conjecture 6 when tied margins are allowed.  It also contains an implementation of Simple Stable Voting with Parallel-Universe Tiebreaking.

4. 04-reversal_ssv.ipynb: This notebook contains the code used to verify the reversal symmetry property for simple stable voting (SSV) as described in Section 5 of the paper.

7. noniso7.txt: A list of the 456 tournament isomorphism classes of size 7.
